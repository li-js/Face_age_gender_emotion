# Age, Gender and Emotion estimation for face images

Train a multi-task learning model to estimate age, gender and emotion of an input face. The trianing is done from multiple datasets, with a mixed-batch strategy. The code is written in Tensorflow.

A similar implementation in Keras is hereï¼š https://github.com/li-js/Train_with_mixed_batch_keras



The code for trunk residual network is borrowed from [here](https://github.com/dalgu90/resnet-18-tensorflow.git).
